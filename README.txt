This is a project to test different Artificial Neural Network models.
The database currently in use is MNIST.
Current method in the project includes:
1) Vanilla Neural Network (vnn). Simpliest neural network. Only consists of three parts:
   feedforward
   stochastic gradient descent
   backpropagation.
